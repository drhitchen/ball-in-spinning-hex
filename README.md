# Ball in Spinning Hexagon

This project consists of several Python programs that simulate bouncing balls inside a spinning hexagon using the Pygame library. The movement of the balls is influenced by gravity, friction, and collisions with the rotating hexagon's walls.

## Features
- **Physics Simulation**: The programs simulate gravitational acceleration, friction, and ball-wall collisions using vector mathematics.
- **Hexagon Rotation**: The hexagon continuously rotates, affecting the ball dynamics.
- **Multiple Variants**:
  - `ball-in-spinning-hex-1.py`: Single ball bouncing inside the hexagon.
  - `ball-in-spinning-hex-2.py`: Two balls bouncing inside the hexagon.
  - `ball-in-spinning-hex-3.py`: Three balls bouncing inside the hexagon.
  - `ball-in-spinning-hex-rand10.py`: Randomly generates up to 10 balls with different velocities and positions.
  - `ball-in-spinning-hex-rand100.py`: Randomly generates up to 100 balls for a more chaotic simulation.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed before running the scripts.

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Simulations
Execute any of the scripts using Python:
```sh
python ball-in-spinning-hex-1.py
```
Replace the filename with any of the other script names to see different variations of the simulation.

## Controls
- Press **ESC** or click the **close button** to exit the simulation.
